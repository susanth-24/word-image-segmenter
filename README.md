Image segmentation is a crucial step in enabling artificial intelligence systems to accurately analyze and interpret visual data, and it has numerous applications in a variety of fields, including handwriting recognition, medical imaging, and autonomous vehicles. By improving the accuracy and efficiency of image segmentation techniques, we can help to unlock the full potential of AI and computer vision.

Image segmentation is a critical component in many applications of computer vision, including handwriting recognition. By breaking down an image into smaller, more manageable segments, image segmentation allows machine learning algorithms to process and analyze images more efficiently and accurately.

This words segmentation was working with scimage for getting the appropriate threshold for accurate binary image( only blacks and whites).
